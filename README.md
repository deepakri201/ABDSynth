This repository accompanies the IEEE Access journal submission of "Benchmarking of AI Algorithms for MRI Abdominal Segmentation", with authors Deepa Krishnaswamy*, Cosmin Ciausu*, Benjamin Billot, Steve Pieper, Ron Kikinis, Andrey Fedorov. (*shared first author)

In this publication, we: 
- Perform a benchmarking study of three state-of-the-art algorithms for segmentation of abdominal structures in MR images to a method utilizing synthetic data 
- Perform an analysis on three difference datasets containing both normal and pathological cases of a variety of MR sequence types 
- For the synthetic data-based approach, SynthSeg (https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg) it utilized, relying only on CT label maps for MR segmentation 

In this repository, we provide 1) the model weights and 2) a demo notebook to run inference on a sample dataset.
