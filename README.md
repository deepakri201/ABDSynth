This repository accompanies the IEEE Access journal submission of "Benchmarking of AI Algorithms for MRI Abdominal Segmentation", with authors Deepa Krishnaswamy*, Cosmin Ciausu*, Benjamin Billot, Steve Pieper, Ron Kikinis, Andrey Fedorov. (*shared first author)

In this repository we provide the model weights, and a demo notebook to run inference on a sample dataset. 

For further information, please see a previous version of an arXiv paper:
